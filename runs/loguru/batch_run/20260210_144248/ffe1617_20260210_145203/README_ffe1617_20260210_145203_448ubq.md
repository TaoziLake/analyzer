# Commit ffe1617: Respect Handler Level in StandardSink

## Summary
This commit introduces level-based filtering in the `StandardSink.write` method to optimize log processing performance. It ensures messages are only processed when their severity meets or exceeds the handler's configured log level threshold. The changes include code modifications, documentation updates, and test additions to validate the new behavior.

---

## Changed Modules
- **`loguru/_simple_sinks.py`**  
  Added log level filtering logic to `StandardSink.write` to respect the `.level` attribute of standard logging handlers.

---

## Affected Functions
### `loguru._simple_sinks.StandardSink.write`
**Change Description:**  
Added a level check at the start of the method:
```python
if message.record["level"].no < self._handler.level:
    return
```
This prevents message formatting and writing when the log level is below the handler's threshold.

**Why:**  
To improve performance by avoiding unnecessary processing of low-severity logs that would be filtered out anyway.

**Downstream Impact:**  
- Applications must ensure handlers have appropriate level configurations to avoid missing expected log messages.
- Redundant custom filters (like those checking `handler.level`) can now be removed, simplifying configuration.

---

## Overall Impact Analysis
The changes work together to:
1. **Optimize Performance**  
   Early filtering at the sink level reduces CPU/memory usage by skipping formatting and I/O operations for unneeded logs.

2. **Align with Standard Logging Practices**  
   Respects the `.level` attribute of standard `logging.Handler` instances, improving compatibility with existing logging configurations.

3. **Simplify User Code**  
   Eliminates the need for manual level checks in custom filters (as shown in the migration guide update).

4. **Require Configuration Awareness**  
   Users must explicitly set handler levels to match their logging requirements, as the default behavior may now suppress unexpected messages.

The addition of comprehensive tests ensures the new logic works correctly with both handler levels and standard logging filters.
