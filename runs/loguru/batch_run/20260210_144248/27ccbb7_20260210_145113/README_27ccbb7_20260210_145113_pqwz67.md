# README: Commit 27ccbb7 in Loguru

## Summary
This commit enhances documentation in the `loguru._logger` module to clarify how numeric severity levels are handled by the `Logger.log` method. While no functional changes were made, the updated docstring explicitly explains the interpretation of integer level values as anonymous severity markers and links to relevant troubleshooting documentation.

---

## Changed Modules
- **`loguru._logger`**  
  Updated docstring in the `Logger.log` method to improve transparency about level value handling. Added reference to FAQ documentation on anonymous levels.

---

## Affected Functions

### `loguru._logger.Logger.log`
- **What Changed**:  
  Added explanatory note in docstring about integer level value interpretation.
- **Why**:  
  To clarify that numeric levels (e.g., `42`) are treated as anonymous severity markers rather than named levels (e.g., "INFO"), aligning with existing behavior described in the project's FAQ.
- **Impact**:  
  - No behavioral changes to logging functionality  
  - Improves developer understanding of level display behavior  
  - Reduces ambiguity for users working with custom numeric severity levels  
  - Directly links to troubleshooting documentation for deeper context

---

## Overall Impact Analysis
This focused documentation update improves the maintainability and usability of the logging API by:
1. Explicitly documenting existing behavior around numeric level handling
2. Creating a direct connection between code-level documentation and project-wide troubleshooting resources
3. Preventing potential confusion about log level display inconsistencies through proactive clarification

The changes maintain backward compatibility while providing clearer guidance for developers using custom severity levels, ultimately reducing support overhead and improving user experience.
