# Commit 78f86ff - Documentation Enhancements for Environment Variable Configuration in Loguru

## Summary
This commit improves documentation across multiple modules to clarify environment variable configuration options in Loguru, with a focus on the `LOGURU_LEVEL` variable. While only the `Logger.add()` method was directly modified, the changes enhance understanding of environment variable-based configuration for logging levels, benefiting users of deprecated `Logger.start()` and `Logger.configure()` through indirect documentation improvements.

---

## Changed Modules
- **`loguru/_logger.py`** (primary changes)
- **Documentation files**: README.md, troubleshooting.rst, recipes.rst

---

## Affected Functions

### `loguru._logger.Logger.add` (Direct Modification)
**What Changed**:  
Added explicit example demonstrating `LOGURU_LEVEL` environment variable usage in the docstring:
```python
# Example now shows:
export LOGURU_LEVEL="WARNING"  # On Linux
```

**Why**:  
To clarify how users can set default logging levels without modifying code, improving discoverability of environment variable configuration.

**Impact**:  
- Users can now easily configure verbosity through environment variables
- Aligns documentation with existing functionality for handler configuration
- Reduces need for programmatic level adjustments in favor of external configuration

---

### `loguru._logger.Logger.start` (Indirect Impact)
**What Changed**:  
No code changes. Improved documentation in `add()` indirectly benefits users of this deprecated method.

**Why**:  
As a deprecated wrapper around `add()`, clarifying `add()`'s environment variable support helps users transition away from `start()`.

**Impact**:  
- Users maintaining legacy code with `start()` gain better context for modern configuration
- No behavioral changes; remains functional but discouraged for new implementations

---

### `loguru._logger.Logger.configure` (Indirect Impact)
**What Changed**:  
No code changes. Documentation improvements in `add()` enhance understanding of handler configuration via environment variables.

**Why**:  
The `configure()` method relies on `add()`'s underlying configuration mechanism, so clarifying environment variable usage in `add()` benefits `configure()` users.

**Impact**:  
- Users setting up handlers through `configure()` better understand default level configuration
- Environment variables now clearly documented as override mechanism for handler parameters

---

## Overall Impact Analysis
This commit enhances Loguru's usability by:
1. **Centralizing Configuration Guidance**: Unified documentation across README, troubleshooting, and API docs demonstrates environment variable usage patterns.
2. **Simplifying Level Management**: Clear `LOGURU_LEVEL` examples reduce reliance on programmatic configuration for common use cases.
3. **Supporting Migration Paths**: Improved `add()` documentation helps users transition from deprecated methods like `start()`.
4. **Consistent Handler Configuration**: Environment variables now explicitly documented as the preferred mechanism for external configuration across all handler setup methods (`add()`, `start()`, `configure()`).

The changes work together to create a more cohesive configuration story, particularly beneficial for containerized deployments and CI/CD environments where environment variables are the primary configuration mechanism. No functional changes were introduced, ensuring backward compatibility while improving user experience.
