A sink can take many forms:\n\n        - A |file-like object|_ like ``sys.stderr`` or ``open(\"file.log\", \"w\")``. Anything with\n          a ``.write()`` method is considered as a file-like object. Custom handlers may also\n          implement ``flush()`` (called after each logged message), ``stop()`` (called at sink\n          termination) and ``complete()`` (awaited by the eponymous method).\n        - A file path as |str| or |Path|. It can be parametrized with some additional parameters,\n          see below.\n        - A |callable|_ (such as a simple function) like ``lambda msg: print(msg)``. This\n          allows for logging procedure entirely defined by user preferences and needs.\n        - A asynchronous |coroutine function|_ defined with the ``async def`` statement. The\n          coroutine object returned by such function will be added to the event loop using\n          |loop.create_task|. The tasks should be awaited before ending the loop by using\n          |complete|.\n        - A built-in |Handler| like ``logging.StreamHandler``. In such a case, the `Loguru` records\n          are automatically converted to the structure expected by the |logging| module.\n\n        Note that the logging functions are not `reentrant`_. This means you should avoid using\n        the ``logger`` inside any of your sinks or from within |signal| handlers. Otherwise, you\n        may face deadlock if the module's sink was not explicitly disabled.\n\n        .. _message:\n\n        .. rubric:: The logged message\n\n        The logged message passed to all added sinks is nothing more than a string of the\n        formatted log, to which a special attribute is associated: the ``.record`` which is a dict\n        containing all contextual information possibly needed (see below).\n\n        Logged messages are formatted according to the ``format`` of the added sink. This format\n        is usually a string containing braces fields to display attributes from the record dict.\n\n        If fine-grained control is needed, the ``format`` can also be a function which takes the\n        record as parameter and return the format template string. However, note that in such a\n        case, you should take care of appending the line ending and exception field to the returned\n        format, while ``\"\\n{exception}\"`` is automatically appended for convenience if ``format`` is\n        a string.\n\n        The ``filter`` attribute can be used to control which messages are effectively passed to the\n        sink and which one are ignored. A function can be used, accepting the record as an\n        argument, and returning ``True`` if the message should be logged, ``False`` otherwise. If\n        a string is used, only the records with the same ``name`` and its children will be allowed.\n        One can also pass a ``dict`` mapping module names to minimum required level. In such case,\n        each log record will search for it's closest parent in the ``dict`` and use the associated\n        level as the filter. The ``dict`` values can be ``int`` severity, ``str`` level name or\n        ``True`` and ``False`` to respectively authorize and discard all module logs\n        unconditionally. In order to set a default level, the ``\"\"`` module name should be used as\n        it is the parent of all modules (it does not suppress global ``level`` threshold, though).\n\n        Note that while calling a logging method, the keyword arguments (if any) are automatically\n        added to the ``extra`` dict for convenient contextualization (in addition to being used for\n        formatting).\n\n        .. _levels:\n\n        .. rubric:: The severity levels\n\n        Each logged message is associated with a severity level. These levels make it possible to\n        prioritize messages and to choose the verbosity of the logs according to usages. For\n        example, it allows to display some debugging information to a developer, while hiding it to\n        the end user running the application.\n\n        The ``level`` attribute of every added sink controls the minimum threshold from which log\n        messages are allowed to be emitted. While using the ``logger``, you are in charge of\n        configuring the appropriate granularity of your logs. It is possible to add even more custom\n        levels by using the |level| method.\n\n        Here are the standard levels with their default severity value, each one is associated with\n        a logging method of the same name:\n\n        +----------------------+------------------------+------------------------+\n        | Level name           | Severity value         | Logger method          |\n        +======================+========================+========================+\n        | ``TRACE``            | 5                      | |logger.trace|         |\n        +----------------------+------------------------+------------------------+\n        | ``DEBUG``            | 10                     | |logger.debug|         |\n        +----------------------+------------------------+------------------------+\n        | ``INFO``             | 20                     | |logger.info|          |\n        +----------------------+------------------------+------------------------+\n        | ``SUCCESS``          | 25                     | |logger.success|       |\n        +----------------------+------------------------+------------------------+\n        | ``WARNING``          | 30                     | |logger.warning|       |\n        +----------------------+------------------------+------------------------+\n        | ``ERROR``            | 40                     | |logger.error|         |\n        +----------------------+------------------------+------------------------+\n        | ``CRITICAL``         | 50                     | |logger.critical|      |\n        +----------------------+------------------------+------------------------+\n\n        .. _record:\n\n        .. rubric:: The record dict\n\n        The record is just a Python dict, accessible from sinks by ``message.record``. It contains\n        all contextual information of the logging call (time, function, file, line, level, etc.).\n\n        Each of the record keys can be used in the handler's ``format`` so the corresponding value\n        is properly displayed in the logged message (e.g. ``\"{level}\"`` will return ``\"INFO\"``).\n        Some records' values are objects with two or more attributes. These can be formatted with\n        ``\"{key.attr}\"`` (``\"{key}\"`` would display one by default).\n\n        Note that you can use any `formatting directives`_ available in Python's ``str.format()``\n        method (e.g. ``\"{key: >3}\"`` will right-align and pad to a width of 3 characters). This is\n        particularly useful for time formatting (see below).\n\n        +------------+---------------------------------+----------------------------+\n        | Key        | Description                     | Attributes                 |\n        +============+=================================+============================+\n        | elapsed    | The time elapsed since the      | See |timedelta|            |\n        |            | start of the program            |                            |\n        +------------+---------------------------------+----------------------------+\n        | exception  | The formatted exception if any, | ``type``, ``value``,       |\n        |            | ``None`` otherwise              | ``traceback``              |\n        +------------+---------------------------------+----------------------------+\n        | extra      | The dict of attributes          | None                       |\n        |            | bound by the user (see |bind|)  |                            |\n        +------------+---------------------------------+----------------------------+\n        | file       | The file where the logging call | ``name`` (default),        |\n        |            | was made                        | ``path``                   |\n        +------------+---------------------------------+----------------------------+\n        | function   | The function from which the     | None                       |\n        |            | logging call was made           |                            |\n        +------------+---------------------------------+----------------------------+\n        | level      | The severity used to log the    | ``name`` (default),        |\n        |            | message                         | ``no``, ``icon``           |\n        +------------+---------------------------------+----------------------------+\n        | line       | The line number in the source   | None                       |\n        |            | code                            |                            |\n        +------------+---------------------------------+----------------------------+\n        | message    | The logged message (not yet     | None                       |\n        |            | formatted)                      |                            |\n        +------------+---------------------------------+----------------------------+\n        | module     | The module where the logging    | None                       |\n        |            | call was made                   |                            |\n        +------------+---------------------------------+----------------------------+\n        | name       | The ``__name__`` where the      | None                       |\n        |            | logging call was made           |                            |\n        +------------+---------------------------------+----------------------------+\n        | process    | The process in which the        | ``name``, ``id`` (default) |\n        |            | logging call was made           |                            |\n        +------------+---------------------------------+----------------------------+\n        | thread     | The thread in which the         | ``name``, ``id`` (default) |\n        |            | logging call was made           |                            |\n        +------------+---------------------------------+----------------------------+\n        | time       | The aware local time when the   | See |datetime|             |\n        |            | logging call was made           |                            |\n        +------------+---------------------------------+----------------------------+\n\n        .. _time:\n\n        .. rubric:: The time formatting\n\n        To use your favorite time representation, you can set it directly in the time formatter\n        specifier of your handler format, like for example ``format=\"{time:HH:mm:ss} {message}\"``.\n        Note that this datetime represents your local time, and it is also made timezone-aware,\n        so you can display the UTC offset to avoid ambiguities.\n\n        The time field can be formatted using more human-friendly tokens. These constitute a subset\n        of the one used by the `Pendulum`_ library of `@sdispater`_. To escape a token, just add\n        square brackets around it, for example ``\"[YY]\"`` would display literally ``\"YY\"``.\n\n        If you prefer to display UTC rather than local time, you can add ``\"!UTC\"`` at the very end\n        of the time format, like ``{time:HH:mm:ss!UTC}``. Doing so will convert the ``datetime``\n        to UTC before formatting.\n\n        If no time formatter specifier is used, like for example if ``format=\"{time} {message}\"``,\n        the default one will use ISO 8601.\n\n        +------------------------+---------+----------------------------------------+\n        |                        | Token   | Output                                 |\n

The file is closed at sink stop, i.e. when the application\n        ends or the handler is removed.\n\n        The ``rotation`` check is made before logging each message. If there is already an existing\n        file with the same name that the file to be created, then the existing file is renamed by\n        appending the date to its basename to prevent file overwriting. This parameter accepts:\n\n        - an |int| which corresponds to the maximum file size in bytes before that the current\n          logged file is closed and a new one started over.\n        - a |timedelta| which indicates the frequency of each new rotation.\n        - a |time| which specifies the hour when the daily rotation should occur.\n        - a |str| for human-friendly parametrization of one of the previously enumerated types.\n          Examples: ``\"100 MB\"``, ``\"0.5 GB\"``, ``\"1 month 2 weeks\"``, ``\"4 days\"``, ``\"10h\"``,\n          ``\"monthly\"``, ``\"18:00\"``, ``\"sunday\"``, ``\"w0\"``, ``\"monday at 12:00\"``, ...\n        - a |callable|_ which will be invoked before logging. It should accept two arguments: the\n          logged message and the file object, and it should return ``True`` if the rotation should\n          happen now, ``False`` otherwise.\n\n        The ``retention`` occurs at rotation or at sink stop if rotation is ``None``. Files\n        resulting from previous sessions or rotations are automatically collected from disk. A file\n        is selected if it matches the pattern ``\"root(.*).ext(.*)\"``, where ``root`` and ``ext`` are\n        derived from ``os.path.splitext()`` applied to the configured sink path (possible time\n        fields are beforehand replaced with ``.*``). Afterwards, the list is processed to determine\n        files to be retained. This parameter accepts:\n\n        - an |int| which indicates the number of log files to keep, while older files are deleted.\n        - a |timedelta| which specifies the maximum age of files to keep.\n        - a |str| for human-friendly parametrization of the maximum age of files to keep.\n          Examples: ``\"1 week, 3 days\"``, ``\"2 months\"``, ...\n        - a |callable|_ which will be invoked before the retention process. It should accept the\n          list of log files as argument and process to whatever it wants (moving files, removing\n          them, etc.).\n\n        The ``compression`` happens at rotation or at sink stop if rotation is ``None``. This\n        parameter accepts:\n\n        - a |str| which corresponds to the compressed or archived file extension. This can be one\n          of: ``\"gz\"``, ``\"bz2\"``, ``\"xz\"``, ``\"lzma\"``, ``\"tar\"``, ``\"tar.gz\"``, ``\"tar.bz2\"``,\n          ``\"tar.xz\"``, ``\"zip\"``.\n        - a |callable|_ which will be invoked after closing (and possibly renaming) the currently\n          logged file. It should accept the path of the log file as argument and process to whatever\n          it wants (custom compression, network sending, renaming it, removing it, etc.).\n\n        Either way, if you use a custom function designed according to your preferences, you must be\n        very careful not to use the ``logger`` within your function. Otherwise, there is a risk that\n        your program hang because of a deadlock.\n\n        .. _color:\n\n        .. rubric:: The color markups\n\n        When the sink supports it, the logs can be colored by using markups in the format string.\n        By default (when ``colorize`` is not specified), these are automatically converted or\n        removed depending on the sink's support for `ANSI codes`_. Loguru also honors the\n        |NO_COLOR|_ and |FORCE_COLOR|_ environment variables (the former taking precedence over the\n        latter).\n\n        To add colors, you just have to enclose your format string with the appropriate tags\n        (e.g. ``<red>some message</red>``). For convenience, you can use ``</>`` to close the last\n        opening tag without repeating its name (e.g. ``<red>another message</>``). The special tag\n        ``<level>`` (abbreviated with ``<lvl>``) is transformed according to the configured color\n        of the logged message level.\n\n        Tags which are not recognized will raise an exception during parsing, to inform you about\n        possible misuse. If you wish to display a markup tag literally, you can escape it by\n        prepending a ``\\`` like for example ``\\<blue>``. To prevent the escaping to occur, you can\n        simply double the ``\\`` (e.g. ``\\\\<blue>`` will print a literal ``\\`` before colored text).\n        If, for some reason, you need to escape a string programmatically, note that the regex used\n        internally to parse markup tags is ``r\"(\\\\*)(</?(?:[fb]g\\s)?[^<>\\s]*>)\"``.\n\n        Note that when logging a message with ``opt(colors=True)``, color tags present in the\n        formatting arguments (``args`` and ``kwargs``) are completely ignored. This is important if\n        you need to log strings containing markups that might interfere with the color tags (in this\n        case, do not use f-string).\n\n        Here are the available tags (note that compatibility may vary depending on terminal):\n\n        +------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+\n        | Color (abbr)                       | Styles (abbr)                        |\n        +====================================+======================================+\n        | Black (k)                          | Bold (b)                             |\n        +------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+\n        | Blue (e)                           | Dim (d)                              |\n        +------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+\n        | Cyan (c)                           | Normal (n)                           |\n        +------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+\n        | Green (g)                          | Italic (i)                           |\n        +------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+\n        | Magenta (m)                        | Underline (u)                        |\n        +------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+\n        | Red (r)                            | Strike (s)                           |\n        +------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+\n        | White (w)                          | Reverse (v)                          |\n        +------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+\n        | Yellow (y)                         | Blink (l)                            |\n        +------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+\n        |                                    | Hide (h)                             |\n        +------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+\n\n        Usage:\n\n        +-----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+\n        | Description     | Examples                                                          |\n        |                 +---------------------------------+---------------------------------+\n        |                 | Foreground                      | Background                      |\n        +=================+=================================+=================================+\n        | Basic colors    | ``<red>``, ``<r>``              | ``<GREEN>``, ``<G>``            |\n        +-----------------+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+\n        | Light colors    | ``<light-blue>``, ``<le>``      | ``<LIGHT-CYAN>``, ``<LC>``      |\n        +-----------------+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+\n        | 8-bit colors    | ``<fg 86>``, ``<fg 255>``       | ``<bg 42>``, ``<bg 9>``         |\n        +-----------------+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+\n        | Hex colors      | ``<fg #00005f>``, ``<fg #EE1>`` | ``<bg #AF5FD7>``, ``<bg #fff>`` |\n        +-----------------+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+\n        | RGB colors      | ``<fg 0,95,0>``                 | ``<bg 72,119,65>``              |\n        +-----------------+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+\n        | Stylizing       | ``<bold>``, ``<b>``,  ``<underline>``, ``<u>``                    |\n        +-----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n        .. _env:\n\n        .. rubric:: The environment variables\n\n        The default values of sink parameters can be entirely customized. This is particularly\n        useful if you don't like the log format of the pre-configured sink.\n\n        Each of the |add| default parameter can be modified by setting the ``LOGURU_[PARAM]``\n        environment variable. For example on Linux: ``export LOGURU_LEVEL=\"WARNING\"``\n        or ``export LOGURU_FORMAT=\"{time} - {message}\"``.\n\n        The default levels' attributes can also be modified by setting the ``LOGURU_[LEVEL]_[ATTR]``\n        environment variable. For example, on Windows: ``setx LOGURU_DEBUG_COLOR \"<blue>\"``\n        or ``setx LOGURU_TRACE_ICON \"🚀\"``. If you use the ``set`` command, do not include quotes\n        but escape special symbol as needed, e.g. ``set LOGURU_DEBUG_COLOR=^<blue^>``.\n\n        If you want to disable the pre-configured sink, you can set the ``LOGURU_AUTOINIT``\n        variable to ``False``.\n\n        On Linux, you will probably need to edit the ``~/.profile`` file to make this persistent. On\n        Windows, don't forget to restart your terminal for the change to be taken into account.\n\n        Examples\n        --------\n        >>> logger.add(sys.stdout, format=\"{time} - {level} - {message}\", filter=\"sub.module\")\n\n        >>> logger.add(\"file_{time}.log\", level=\"TRACE\", rotation=\"100 MB\")\n\n        >>> def debug_only(record):\n        ...     return record[\"level\"].name == \"DEBUG\"\n        ...\n        >>> logger.add(\"debug.log\", filter=debug_only)  # Other levels are filtered out\n\n        >>> def my_sink(message):\n        ...     record = message.record\n        ...     update_db(message, time=record[\"time\"], level=record[\"level\"])\n        ...\n        >>> logger.add(my_sink)\n\n        >>> level_per_module = {\n        ...     \"\": \"DEBUG\",\n        ...     \"third.lib\": \"WARNING\",\n        ...     \"anotherlib\": False\n        ... }\n        >>> logger.add(lambda m: print(m, end=\"\"), filter=level_per_module, level=0)\n\n        >>> async def publish(message):\n        ...     await api.post(message)\n        ...\n        >>> logger.add(publish, serialize=True)\n\n        >>> from logging import StreamHandler\n        >>> logger.add(StreamHandler(sys.stderr), format=\"{message}\")\n\n        >>> class RandomStream:\n        ...     def __init__(self, seed, threshold):\n        ...         self.threshold = threshold\n        ...         random.seed(seed)\n        ...     def write(self, message):\n        ...         if random.random() > self.threshold:\n        ...             print(message)\n        ...\n        >>> stream_object = RandomStream(seed=12345, threshold=0.25)\n        >>> logger.add(stream_object, level=\"INFO\")\n        \"\"\"\n        with self._core.lock:\n            handler_id = self._core.handlers_count\n            self._core.handlers_count += 1\n\n        error_interceptor = ErrorInterceptor(catch, handler_id)\n\n        if colorize is None and serialize:\n            colorize = False\n\n        if isinstance(sink, (str, PathLike)):\n            path = sink\n            name = \"'%s'\" % path\n\n            if colorize is None:\n                colorize = False\n\n            wrapped_sink = FileSink(path, **kwargs)\n            kwargs = {}\n            encoding = wrapped_sink.encoding\n            terminator = \"\\n\"\n            exception_prefix = \"\"\n        elif hasattr(sink, \"write\") and callable(sink.write):\n            name = getattr(sink, \"name\", None) or repr(sink)\n\n            if colorize is None:\n                colorize = _colorama.should_colorize(sink)\n\n            if colorize is True and _colorama.should_wrap(sink):\n                stream = _colorama.wrap(sink)\n            else:\n                stream = sink\n\n            wrapped_sink = StreamSink(stream)\n            encoding = getattr(sink, \"encoding\", None)\n            terminator = \"\\n\"\n            exception_prefix = \"\"\n        elif isinstance(sink, logging.Handler):\n            name = repr(sink)\n\n            if colorize is None:\n                colorize = False\n\n            wrapped_sink = StandardSink(sink)\n            encoding = getattr(sink, \"encoding\", None)\n            terminator = \"\"\n            exception_prefix = \"\\n\"\n        elif iscoroutinefunction(sink) or iscoroutinefunction(\n            getattr(sink, \"__call__\", None)  # noqa: B004\n        ):\n            name = getattr(sink, \"__name__\", None) or repr(sink)\n\n            if colorize is None:\n                colorize = False\n\n            loop = kwargs.pop(\"loop\", None)\n\n            # The worker thread needs an event loop, it can't create a new one internally because it\n            # has to be accessible by the user while calling \"complete()\", instead we use the global\n            # one when the sink is added.

Custom handlers may also\n          implement ``flush()`` (called after each logged message), ``stop()`` (called at sink\n          termination) and ``complete()`` (awaited by the eponymous method).\n        - A file path as |str| or |Path|. It can be parametrized with some additional parameters,\n          see below.\n        - A |callable|_ (such as a simple function) like ``lambda msg: print(msg)``. This\n          allows for logging procedure entirely defined by user preferences and needs.\n        - A asynchronous |coroutine function|_ defined with the ``async def`` statement. The\n          coroutine object returned by such function will be added to the event loop using\n          |loop.create_task|. The tasks should be awaited before ending the loop by using\n          |complete|.\n        - A built-in |Handler| like ``logging.StreamHandler``. In such a case, the `Loguru` records\n          are automatically converted to the structure expected by the |logging| module.\n\n        Note that the logging functions are not `reentrant`_. This means you should avoid using\n        the ``logger`` inside any of your sinks or from within |signal| handlers. Otherwise, you\n        may face deadlock if the module's sink was not explicitly disabled.\n\n        .. _message:\n\n        .. rubric:: The logged message\n\n        The logged message passed to all added sinks is nothing more than a string of the\n        formatted log, to which a special attribute is associated: the ``.record`` which is a dict\n        containing all contextual information possibly needed (see below).\n\n        Logged messages are formatted according to the ``format`` of the added sink. This format\n        is usually a string containing braces fields to display attributes from the record dict.\n\n        If fine-grained control is needed, the ``format`` can also be a function which takes the\n        record as parameter and return the format template string. However, note that in such a\n        case, you should take care of appending the line ending and exception field to the returned\n        format, while ``\"\\n{exception}\"`` is automatically appended for convenience if ``format`` is\n        a string.\n\n        The ``filter`` attribute can be used to control which messages are effectively passed to the\n        sink and which one are ignored. A function can be used, accepting the record as an\n        argument, and returning ``True`` if the message should be logged, ``False`` otherwise. If\n        a string is used, only the records with the same ``name`` and its children will be allowed.\n        One can also pass a ``dict`` mapping module names to minimum required level. In such case,\n        each log record will search for it's closest parent in the ``dict`` and use the associated\n        level as the filter. The ``dict`` values can be ``int`` severity, ``str`` level name or\n        ``True`` and ``False`` to respectively authorize and discard all module logs\n        unconditionally. In order to set a default level, the ``\"\"`` module name should be used as\n        it is the parent of all modules (it does not suppress global ``level`` threshold, though).\n\n        Note that while calling a logging method, the keyword arguments (if any) are automatically\n        added to the ``extra`` dict for convenient contextualization (in addition to being used for\n        formatting).\n\n        .. _levels:\n\n        .. rubric:: The severity levels\n\n        Each logged message is associated with a severity level. These levels make it possible to\n        prioritize messages and to choose the verbosity of the logs according to usages. For\n        example, it allows to display some debugging information to a developer, while hiding it to\n        the end user running the application.\n\n        The ``level`` attribute of every added sink controls the minimum threshold from which log\n        messages are allowed to be emitted. While using the ``logger``, you are in charge of\n        configuring the appropriate granularity of your logs. It is possible to add even more custom\n        levels by using the |level| method.\n\n        Here are the standard levels with their default severity value, each one is associated with\n        a logging method of the same name:\n\n        +----------------------+------------------------+------------------------+\n        | Level name           | Severity value         | Logger method          |\n        +======================+========================+========================+\n        | ``TRACE``            | 5                      | |logger.trace|         |\n        +----------------------+------------------------+------------------------+\n        | ``DEBUG``            | 10                     | |logger.debug|         |\n        +----------------------+------------------------+------------------------+\n        | ``INFO``             | 20                     | |logger.info|          |\n        +----------------------+------------------------+------------------------+\n        | ``SUCCESS``          | 25                     | |logger.success|       |\n        +----------------------+------------------------+------------------------+\n        | ``WARNING``          | 30                     | |logger.warning|       |\n        +----------------------+------------------------+------------------------+\n        | ``ERROR``            | 40                     | |logger.error|         |\n        +----------------------+------------------------+------------------------+\n        | ``CRITICAL``         | 50                     | |logger.critical|      |\n        +----------------------+------------------------+------------------------+\n\n        .. _record:\n\n        .. rubric:: The record dict\n\n        The record is just a Python dict, accessible from sinks by ``message.record``. It contains\n        all contextual information of the logging call (time, function, file, line, level, etc.).\n\n        Each of the record keys can be used in the handler's ``format`` so the corresponding value\n        is properly displayed in the logged message (e.g. ``\"{level}\"`` will return ``\"INFO\"``).\n        Some records' values are objects with two or more attributes. These can be formatted with\n        ``\"{key.attr}\"`` (``\"{key}\"`` would display one by default).\n\n        Note that you can use any `formatting directives`_ available in Python's ``str.format()``\n        method (e.g. ``\"{key: >3}\"`` will right-align and pad to a width of 3 characters). This is\n        particularly useful for time formatting (see below).\n\n        +------------+---------------------------------+----------------------------+\n        | Key        | Description                     | Attributes                 |\n        +============+=================================+============================+\n        | elapsed    | The time elapsed since the      | See |timedelta|            |\n        |            | start of the program            |                            |\n        +------------+---------------------------------+----------------------------+\n        | exception  | The formatted exception if any, | ``type``, ``value``,       |\n        |            | ``None`` otherwise              | ``traceback``              |\n        +------------+---------------------------------+----------------------------+\n        | extra      | The dict of attributes          | None                       |\n        |            | bound by the user (see |bind|)  |                            |\n        +------------+---------------------------------+----------------------------+\n        | file       | The file where the logging call | ``name`` (default),        |\n        |            | was made                        | ``path``                   |\n        +------------+---------------------------------+----------------------------+\n        | function   | The function from which the     | None                       |\n        |            | logging call was made           |                            |\n        +------------+---------------------------------+----------------------------+\n        | level      | The severity used to log the    | ``name`` (default),        |\n        |            | message                         | ``no``, ``icon``           |\n        +------------+---------------------------------+----------------------------+\n        | line       | The line number in the source   | None                       |\n        |            | code                            |                            |\n        +------------+---------------------------------+----------------------------+\n        | message    | The logged message (not yet     | None                       |\n        |            | formatted)                      |                            |\n        +------------+---------------------------------+----------------------------+\n        | module     | The module where the logging    | None                       |\n        |            | call was made                   |                            |\n        +------------+---------------------------------+----------------------------+\n        | name       | The ``__name__`` where the      | None                       |\n        |            | logging call was made           |                            |\n        +------------+---------------------------------+----------------------------+\n        | process    | The process in which the        | ``name``, ``id`` (default) |\n        |            | logging call was made           |                            |\n        +------------+---------------------------------+----------------------------+\n        | thread     | The thread in which the         | ``name``, ``id`` (default) |\n        |            | logging call was made           |                            |\n        +------------+---------------------------------+----------------------------+\n        | time       | The aware local time when the   | See |datetime|             |\n        |            | logging call was made           |                            |\n        +------------+---------------------------------+----------------------------+\n\n        .. _time:\n\n        .. rubric:: The time formatting\n\n        To use your favorite time representation, you can set it directly in the time formatter\n        specifier of your handler format, like for example ``format=\"{time:HH:mm:ss} {message}\"``.\n        Note that this datetime represents your local time, and it is also made timezone-aware,\n        so you can display the UTC offset to avoid ambiguities.\n\n        The time field can be formatted using more human-friendly tokens. These constitute a subset\n        of the one used by the `Pendulum`_ library of `@sdispater`_. To escape a token, just add\n        square brackets around it, for example ``\"[YY]\"`` would display literally ``\"YY\"``.\n\n        If you prefer to display UTC rather than local time, you can add ``\"!UTC\"`` at the very end\n        of the time format, like ``{time:HH:mm:ss!UTC}``. Doing so will convert the ``datetime``\n        to UTC before formatting.\n\n        If no time formatter specifier is used, like for example if ``format=\"{time} {message}\"``,\n        the default one will use ISO 8601.\n\n        +------------------------+---------+----------------------------------------+\n        |                        | Token   | Output                                 |\n

The file is closed at sink stop, i.e. when the application\n        ends or the handler is removed.\n\n        The ``rotation`` check is made before logging each message. If there is already an existing\n        file with the same name that the file to be created, then the existing file is renamed by\n        appending the date to its basename to prevent file overwriting. This parameter accepts:\n\n        - an |int| which corresponds to the maximum file size in bytes before that the current\n          logged file is closed and a new one started over.\n        - a |timedelta| which indicates the frequency of each new rotation.\n        - a |time| which specifies the hour when the daily rotation should occur.\n        - a |str| for human-friendly parametrization of one of the previously enumerated types.\n          Examples: ``\"100 MB\"``, ``\"0.5 GB\"``, ``\"1 month 2 weeks\"``, ``\"4 days\"``, ``\"10h\"``,\n          ``\"monthly\"``, ``\"18:00\"``, ``\"sunday\"``, ``\"w0\"``, ``\"monday at 12:00\"``, ...\n        - a |callable|_ which will be invoked before logging. It should accept two arguments: the\n          logged message and the file object, and it should return ``True`` if the rotation should\n          happen now, ``False`` otherwise.\n\n        The ``retention`` occurs at rotation or at sink stop if rotation is ``None``. Files\n        resulting from previous sessions or rotations are automatically collected from disk. A file\n        is selected if it matches the pattern ``\"root(.*).ext(.*)\"``, where ``root`` and ``ext`` are\n        derived from ``os.path.splitext()`` applied to the configured sink path (possible time\n        fields are beforehand replaced with ``.*``). Afterwards, the list is processed to determine\n        files to be retained. This parameter accepts:\n\n        - an |int| which indicates the number of log files to keep, while older files are deleted.\n        - a |timedelta| which specifies the maximum age of files to keep.\n        - a |str| for human-friendly parametrization of the maximum age of files to keep.\n          Examples: ``\"1 week, 3 days\"``, ``\"2 months\"``, ...\n        - a |callable|_ which will be invoked before the retention process. It should accept the\n          list of log files as argument and process to whatever it wants (moving files, removing\n          them, etc.).\n\n        The ``compression`` happens at rotation or at sink stop if rotation is ``None``. This\n        parameter accepts:\n\n        - a |str| which corresponds to the compressed or archived file extension. This can be one\n          of: ``\"gz\"``, ``\"bz2\"``, ``\"xz\"``, ``\"lzma\"``, ``\"tar\"``, ``\"tar.gz\"``, ``\"tar.bz2\"``,\n          ``\"tar.xz\"``, ``\"zip\"``.\n        - a |callable|_ which will be invoked after closing (and possibly renaming) the currently\n          logged file. It should accept the path of the log file as argument and process to whatever\n          it wants (custom compression, network sending, renaming it, removing it, etc.).\n\n        Either way, if you use a custom function designed according to your preferences, you must be\n        very careful not to use the ``logger`` within your function. Otherwise, there is a risk that\n        your program hang because of a deadlock.\n\n        .. _color:\n\n        .. rubric:: The color markups\n\n        When the sink supports it, the logs can be colored by using markups in the format string.\n        By default (when ``colorize`` is not specified), these are automatically converted or\n        removed depending on the sink's support for `ANSI codes`_. Loguru also honors the\n        |NO_COLOR|_ and |FORCE_COLOR|_ environment variables (the former taking precedence over the\n        latter).\n\n        To add colors, you just have to enclose your format string with the appropriate tags\n        (e.g. ``<red>some message</red>``). For convenience, you can use ``</>`` to close the last\n        opening tag without repeating its name (e.g. ``<red>another message</>``). The special tag\n        ``<level>`` (abbreviated with ``<lvl>``) is transformed according to the configured color\n        of the logged message level.\n\n        Tags which are not recognized will raise an exception during parsing, to inform you about\n        possible misuse. If you wish to display a markup tag literally, you can escape it by\n        prepending a ``\\`` like for example ``\\<blue>``. To prevent the escaping to occur, you can\n        simply double the ``\\`` (e.g. ``\\\\<blue>`` will print a literal ``\\`` before colored text).\n        If, for some reason, you need to escape a string programmatically, note that the regex used\n        internally to parse markup tags is ``r\"(\\\\*)(</?(?:[fb]g\\s)?[^<>\\s]*>)\"``.\n\n        Note that when logging a message with ``opt(colors=True)``, color tags present in the\n        formatting arguments (``args`` and ``kwargs``) are completely ignored. This is important if\n        you need to log strings containing markups that might interfere with the color tags (in this\n        case, do not use f-string).\n\n        Here are the available tags (note that compatibility may vary depending on terminal):\n\n        +------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+\n        | Color (abbr)                       | Styles (abbr)                        |\n        +====================================+======================================+\n        | Black (k)                          | Bold (b)                             |\n        +------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+\n        | Blue (e)                           | Dim (d)                              |\n        +------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+\n        | Cyan (c)                           | Normal (n)                           |\n        +------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+\n        | Green (g)                          | Italic (i)                           |\n        +------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+\n        | Magenta (m)                        | Underline (u)                        |\n        +------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+\n        | Red (r)                            | Strike (s)                           |\n        +------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+\n        | White (w)                          | Reverse (v)                          |\n        +------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+\n        | Yellow (y)                         | Blink (l)                            |\n        +------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+\n        |                                    | Hide (h)                             |\n        +------------------------------------+--------------------------------------+\n\n        Usage:\n\n        +-----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+\n        | Description     | Examples                                                          |\n        |                 +---------------------------------+---------------------------------+\n        |                 | Foreground                      | Background                      |\n        +=================+=================================+=================================+\n        | Basic colors    | ``<red>``, ``<r>``              | ``<GREEN>``, ``<G>``            |\n        +-----------------+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+\n        | Light colors    | ``<light-blue>``, ``<le>``      | ``<LIGHT-CYAN>``, ``<LC>``      |\n        +-----------------+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+\n        | 8-bit colors    | ``<fg 86>``, ``<fg 255>``       | ``<bg 42>``, ``<bg 9>``         |\n        +-----------------+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+\n        | Hex colors      | ``<fg #00005f>``, ``<fg #EE1>`` | ``<bg #AF5FD7>``, ``<bg #fff>`` |\n        +-----------------+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+\n        | RGB colors      | ``<fg 0,95,0>``                 | ``<bg 72,119,65>``              |\n        +-----------------+---------------------------------+---------------------------------+\n        | Stylizing       | ``<bold>``, ``<b>``,  ``<underline>``, ``<u>``                    |\n        +-----------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+\n\n        .. _env:\n\n        .. rubric:: The environment variables\n\n        The default values of sink parameters can be entirely customized. This is particularly\n        useful if you don't like the log format of the pre-configured sink.\n\n        Each of the |add| default parameter can be modified by setting the ``LOGURU_[PARAM]``\n        environment variable. For example on Linux: ``export LOGURU_FORMAT=\"{time} - {message}\"``\n        or ``export LOGURU_DIAGNOSE=NO``.\n\n        The default levels' attributes can also be modified by setting the ``LOGURU_[LEVEL]_[ATTR]``\n        environment variable. For example, on Windows: ``setx LOGURU_DEBUG_COLOR \"<blue>\"``\n        or ``setx LOGURU_TRACE_ICON \"🚀\"``. If you use the ``set`` command, do not include quotes\n        but escape special symbol as needed, e.g. ``set LOGURU_DEBUG_COLOR=^<blue^>``.\n\n        If you want to disable the pre-configured sink, you can set the ``LOGURU_AUTOINIT``\n        variable to ``False``.\n\n        On Linux, you will probably need to edit the ``~/.profile`` file to make this persistent. On\n        Windows, don't forget to restart your terminal for the change to be taken into account.\n\n        Examples\n        --------\n        >>> logger.add(sys.stdout, format=\"{time} - {level} - {message}\", filter=\"sub.module\")\n\n        >>> logger.add(\"file_{time}.log\", level=\"TRACE\", rotation=\"100 MB\")\n\n        >>> def debug_only(record):\n        ...     return record[\"level\"].name == \"DEBUG\"\n        ...\n        >>> logger.add(\"debug.log\", filter=debug_only)  # Other levels are filtered out\n\n        >>> def my_sink(message):\n        ...     record = message.record\n        ...     update_db(message, time=record[\"time\"], level=record[\"level\"])\n        ...\n        >>> logger.add(my_sink)\n\n        >>> level_per_module = {\n        ...     \"\": \"DEBUG\",\n        ...     \"third.lib\": \"WARNING\",\n        ...     \"anotherlib\": False\n        ... }\n        >>> logger.add(lambda m: print(m, end=\"\"), filter=level_per_module, level=0)\n\n        >>> async def publish(message):\n        ...     await api.post(message)\n        ...\n        >>> logger.add(publish, serialize=True)\n\n        >>> from logging import StreamHandler\n        >>> logger.add(StreamHandler(sys.stderr), format=\"{message}\")\n\n        >>> class RandomStream:\n        ...     def __init__(self, seed, threshold):\n        ...         self.threshold = threshold\n        ...         random.seed(seed)\n        ...     def write(self, message):\n        ...         if random.random() > self.threshold:\n        ...             print(message)\n        ...\n        >>> stream_object = RandomStream(seed=12345, threshold=0.25)\n        >>> logger.add(stream_object, level=\"INFO\")\n        \"\"\"\n        with self._core.lock:\n            handler_id = self._core.handlers_count\n            self._core.handlers_count += 1\n\n        error_interceptor = ErrorInterceptor(catch, handler_id)\n\n        if colorize is None and serialize:\n            colorize = False\n\n        if isinstance(sink, (str, PathLike)):\n            path = sink\n            name = \"'%s'\" % path\n\n            if colorize is None:\n                colorize = False\n\n            wrapped_sink = FileSink(path, **kwargs)\n            kwargs = {}\n            encoding = wrapped_sink.encoding\n            terminator = \"\\n\"\n            exception_prefix = \"\"\n        elif hasattr(sink, \"write\") and callable(sink.write):\n            name = getattr(sink, \"name\", None) or repr(sink)\n\n            if colorize is None:\n                colorize = _colorama.should_colorize(sink)\n\n            if colorize is True and _colorama.should_wrap(sink):\n                stream = _colorama.wrap(sink)\n            else:\n                stream = sink\n\n            wrapped_sink = StreamSink(stream)\n            encoding = getattr(sink, \"encoding\", None)\n            terminator = \"\\n\"\n            exception_prefix = \"\"\n        elif isinstance(sink, logging.Handler):\n            name = repr(sink)\n\n            if colorize is None:\n                colorize = False\n\n            wrapped_sink = StandardSink(sink)\n            encoding = getattr(sink, \"encoding\", None)\n            terminator = \"\"\n            exception_prefix = \"\\n\"\n        elif iscoroutinefunction(sink) or iscoroutinefunction(\n            getattr(sink, \"__call__\", None)  # noqa: B004\n        ):\n            name = getattr(sink, \"__name__\", None) or repr(sink)\n\n            if colorize is None:\n                colorize = False\n\n            loop = kwargs.pop(\"loop\", None)\n\n            # The worker thread needs an event loop, it can't create a new one internally because it\n            # has to be accessible by the user while calling \"complete()\", instead we use the global\n            # one when the sink is added.
