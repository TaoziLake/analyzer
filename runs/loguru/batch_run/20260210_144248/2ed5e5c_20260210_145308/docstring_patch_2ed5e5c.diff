-        Extended summary follows.
-
-        .. _sink:
-
-        .. rubric:: The sink parameter
-
-        The ``sink`` handles incoming log messages and proceed to their writing somewhere and
-        somehow. A sink can take many forms:
-
-        - A |file-like object|_ like ``sys.stderr`` or ``open("file.log", "w")``. Anything with
-          a ``.write()`` method is considered as a file-like object. Custom handlers may also
-          implement ``flush()`` (called after each logged message), ``stop()`` (called at sink
-          termination) and ``complete()`` (awaited by the eponymous method).
-        - A file path as |str| or |Path|. It can be parametrized with some additional parameters,
-          see below.
-        - A |callable|_ (such as a simple function) like ``lambda msg: print(msg)``. This
-          allows for logging procedure entirely defined by user preferences and needs.
-        - A asynchronous |coroutine function|_ defined with the ``async def`` statement. The
-          coroutine object returned by such function will be added to the event loop using
-          |loop.create_task|. The tasks should be awaited before ending the loop by using
-          |complete|.
-        - A built-in |Handler| like ``logging.StreamHandler``. In such a case, the `Loguru` records
-          are automatically converted to the structure expected by the |logging| module.
-
-        Note that the logging functions are not `reentrant`_. This means you should avoid using
-        the ``logger`` inside any of your sinks or from within |signal| handlers. Otherwise, you
-        may face deadlock if the module's sink was not explicitly disabled.
-
-        .. _message:
-
-        .. rubric:: The logged message
-
-        The logged message passed to all added sinks is nothing more than a string of the
-        formatted log, to which a special attribute is associated: the ``.record`` which is a dict
-        containing all contextual information possibly needed (see below).
-
-        Logged messages are formatted according to the ``format`` of the added sink. This format
-        is usually a string containing braces fields to display attributes from the record dict.
-
-        If fine-grained control is needed, the ``format`` can also be a function which takes the
-        record as parameter and must return the unformatted template string. It is critical that
-        this string has not been pre-formatted, as Loguru will handle the actual formatting later.
-        Returning an already formatted log message would break internal mechanisms and lead to
-        runtime errors. Note that when using a function, you are also responsible for appending the
-        line ending and the exception field, whereas ``"\n{exception}"`` is automatically appended
-        for convenience when the ``format`` is a string.
-
-        The ``filter`` attribute can be used to control which messages are effectively passed to the
-        sink and which one are ignored. A function can be used, accepting the record as an
-        argument, and returning ``True`` if the message should be logged, ``False`` otherwise. If
-        a string is used, only the records with the same ``name`` and its children will be allowed.
-        One can also pass a ``dict`` mapping module names to minimum required level. In such case,
-        each log record will search for it's closest parent in the ``dict`` and use the associated
-        level as the filter. The ``dict`` values can be ``int`` severity, ``str`` level name or
-        ``True`` and ``False`` to respectively authorize and discard all module logs
-        unconditionally. In order to set a default level, the ``""`` module name should be used as
-        it is the parent of all modules (it does not suppress global ``level`` threshold, though).
-
-        Note that while calling a logging method, the keyword arguments (if any) are automatically
-        added to the ``extra`` dict for convenient contextualization (in addition to being used for
-        formatting).
-
-        .. _levels:
-
-        .. rubric:: The severity levels
-
-        Each logged message is associated with a severity level. These levels make it possible to
-        prioritize messages and to choose the verbosity of the logs according to usages. For
-        example, it allows to display some debugging information to a developer, while hiding it to
-        the end user running the application.
-
-        The ``level`` attribute of every added sink controls the minimum threshold from which log
-        messages are allowed to be emitted. While using the ``logger``, you are in charge of
-        configuring the appropriate granularity of your logs. It is possible to add even more custom
-        levels by using the |level| method.
-
-        Here are the standard levels with their default severity value, each one is associated with
-        a logging method of the same name:
-
-        +----------------------+------------------------+------------------------+
-        | Level name           | Severity value         | Logger method          |

-        +----------------------+------------------------+------------------------+

-        +----------------------+------------------------+------------------------+

-        +----------------------+------------------------+------------------------+
-        | ``SUCCESS``          | 25                     | |logger.success|       |
-        +----------------------+------------------------+------------------------+
-        | ``WARNING``          | 30                     | |logger.warning|       |
-        +----------------------+------------------------+------------------------+

-        +----------------------+------------------------+------------------------+

-
-        .. _record:
-
-        .. rubric:: The record dict
-
-        The record is just a Python dict, accessible from sinks by ``message.record``. It contains
-        all contextual information of the logging call (time, function, file, line, level, etc.).
-
-        Each of the record keys can be used in the handler's ``format`` so the corresponding value
-        is properly displayed in the logged message (e.g. ``"{level}"`` will return ``"INFO"``).
-        Some records' values are objects with two or more attributes. These can be formatted with
-        ``"{key.attr}"`` (``"{key}"`` would display one by default).
-
-        Note that you can use any `formatting directives`_ available in Python's ``str.format()``
-        method (e.g. ``"{key: >3}"`` will right-align and pad to a width of 3 characters). This is
-        particularly useful for time formatting (see below).

-
-        .. _time:
-
-        .. rubric:: The time formatting
-
-        To use your favorite time representation, you can set it directly in the time formatter
-        specifier of your handler format, like for example ``format="{time:HH:mm:ss} {message}"``.
-        Note that this datetime represents your local time, and it is also made timezone-aware,
-        so you can display the UTC offset to avoid ambiguities.
-
-        The time field can be formatted using more human-friendly tokens. These constitute a subset
-        of the one used by the `Pendulum`_ library of `@sdispater`_. To escape a token, just add
-        square brackets around it, for example ``"[YY]"`` would display literally ``"YY"``.
-
-        If you prefer to display UTC rather than local time, you can add ``"!UTC"`` at the very end
-        of the time format, like ``{time:HH:mm:ss!UTC}``. Doing so will convert the ``datetime``
-        to UTC before formatting.
-
-        If no time formatter specifier is used, like for example if ``format="{time} {message}"``,
-        the default one will use ISO 8601.

-        .. _file:
-
-        .. rubric:: The file sinks
-
-        If the sink is a |str| or a |Path|, the corresponding file will be opened for writing logs.
-        The path can also contain a special ``"{time}"`` field that will be formatted with the
-        current date at file creation. The file is closed at sink stop, i.e. when the application
-        ends or the handler is removed.
-
-        The ``rotation`` check is made before logging each message. If there is already an existing
-        file with the same name that the file to be created, then the existing file is renamed by
-        appending the date to its basename to prevent file overwriting. This parameter accepts:
-
-        - an |int| which corresponds to the maximum file size in bytes before that the current
-          logged file is closed and a new one started over.
-        - a |timedelta| which indicates the frequency of each new rotation.
-        - a |time| which specifies the hour when the daily rotation should occur.
-        - a |str| for human-friendly parametrization of one of the previously enumerated types.
-          Examples: ``"100 MB"``, ``"0.5 GB"``, ``"1 month 2 weeks"``, ``"4 days"``, ``"10h"``,
-          ``"monthly"``, ``"18:00"``, ``"sunday"``, ``"w0"``, ``"monday at 12:00"``, ...
-        - a |callable|_ which will be invoked before logging. It should accept two arguments: the
-          logged message and the file object, and it should return ``True`` if the rotation should
-          happen now, ``False`` otherwise.
-
-        The ``retention`` occurs at rotation or at sink stop if rotation is ``None``. Files
-        resulting from previous sessions or rotations are automatically collected from disk. A file
-        is selected if it matches the pattern ``"root(.*).ext(.*)"``, where ``root`` and ``ext`` are
-        derived from ``os.path.splitext()`` applied to the configured sink path (possible time
-        fields are beforehand replaced with ``.*``). Afterwards, the list is processed to determine
-        files to be retained. This parameter accepts:
-
-        - an |int| which indicates the number of log files to keep, while older files are deleted.
-        - a |timedelta| which specifies the maximum age of files to keep.
-        - a |str| for human-friendly parametrization of the maximum age of files to keep.
-          Examples: ``"1 week, 3 days"``, ``"2 months"``, ...
-        - a |callable|_ which will be invoked before the retention process. It should accept the
-          list of log files as argument and process to whatever it wants (moving files, removing
-          them, etc.).
-
-        The ``compression`` happens at rotation or at sink stop if rotation is ``None``. This
-        parameter accepts:
-
-        - a |str| which corresponds to the compressed or archived file extension. This can be one
-          of: ``"gz"``, ``"bz2"``, ``"xz"``, ``"lzma"``, ``"tar"``, ``"tar.gz"``, ``"tar.bz2"``,
-          ``"tar.xz"``, ``"zip"``.
-        - a |callable|_ which will be invoked after closing (and possibly renaming) the currently
-          logged file. It should accept the path of the log file as argument and process to whatever
-          it wants (custom compression, network sending, renaming it, removing it, etc.).
-
-        Either way, if you use a custom function designed according to your preferences, you must be
-        very careful not to use the ``logger`` within your function. Otherwise, there is a risk that
-        your program hang because of a deadlock.
-
-        .. _color:
-
-        .. rubric:: The color markups
-
-        When the sink supports it, the logs can be colored by using markups in the format string.
-        By default (when ``colorize`` is not specified), these are automatically converted or
-        removed depending on the sink's support for `ANSI codes`_. Loguru also honors the
-        |NO_COLOR|_ and |FORCE_COLOR|_ environment variables (the former taking precedence over the
-        latter).
-
-        To add colors, you just have to enclose your format string with the appropriate tags
-        (e.g. ``<red>some message</red>``). For convenience, you can use ``</>`` to close the last
-        opening tag without repeating its name (e.g. ``<red>another message</>``). The special tag
-        ``<level>`` (abbreviated with ``<lvl>``) is transformed according to the configured color
-        of the logged message level.
-
-        Tags which are not recognized will raise an exception during parsing, to inform you about
-        possible misuse. If you wish to display a markup tag literally, you can escape it by
-        prepending a ``\`` like for example ``\<blue>``. To prevent the escaping to occur, you can
-        simply double the ``\`` (e.g. ``\\<blue>`` will print a literal ``\`` before colored text).
-        If, for some reason, you need to escape a string programmatically, note that the regex used
-        internally to parse markup tags is ``r"(\\*)(</?(?:[fb]g\s)?[^<>\s]*>)"``.
-
-        Note that when logging a message with ``opt(colors=True)``, color tags present in the
-        formatting arguments (``args`` and ``kwargs``) are completely ignored. This is important if
-        you need to log strings containing markups that might interfere with the color tags (in this
-        case, do not use f-string).
-
-        Here are the available tags (note that compatibility may vary depending on terminal):

-        .. _env:
-
-        .. rubric:: The environment variables
-
-        The default values of sink parameters can be entirely customized. This is particularly
-        useful if you don't like the log format of the pre-configured sink.
-
-        Each of the |add| default parameter can be modified by setting the ``LOGURU_[PARAM]``
-        environment variable. For example on Linux: ``export LOGURU_LEVEL="WARNING"``
-        or ``export LOGURU_FORMAT="{time} - {message}"``.
-
-        The default levels' attributes can also be modified by setting the ``LOGURU_[LEVEL]_[ATTR]``
-        environment variable. For example, on Windows: ``setx LOGURU_DEBUG_COLOR "<blue>"``
-        or ``setx LOGURU_TRACE_ICON "🚀"``. If you use the ``set`` command, do not include quotes
-        but escape special symbol as needed, e.g. ``set LOGURU_DEBUG_COLOR=^<blue^>``.
-
-        If you want to disable the pre-configured sink, you can set the ``LOGURU_AUTOINIT``
-        variable to ``False``.
-
-        On Linux, you will probably need to edit the ``~/.profile`` file to make this persistent. On
-        Windows, don't forget to restart your terminal for the change to be taken into account.

+            If dynamic formatter returns pre-formatted strings (due to stricter validation in ``add()``).

+        Changelog:
+            2ed5e5c: The stricter dynamic formatter validation from ``add()`` now indirectly affects ``start()``.
+            Callers using callable formatters must ensure they return unformatted template strings with
+            placeholders intact. Pre-formatted strings will raise errors during handler configuration.
