# Commit cd1ad91 Summary: Optimizing Markdown Parser Initialization

## Executive Summary
This commit optimizes the `get_markdown_parsers` function in `benchmark/bench.py` by removing redundant f-string formatting operations from mistune parser keys. While maintaining identical functionality, this change reduces runtime overhead during parser initialization and improves code readability. The indirect beneficiary is the `benchmarks` function, which now experiences faster parser setup without any behavioral changes.

---

## Changed Modules
- `benchmark/bench.py` (parser initialization logic)

---

## Affected Functions

### `benchmark.bench.get_markdown_parsers`
- **What Changed**: Removed f-string formatting from `"mistune (slow)"` and `"mistune (fast)"` dictionary keys
- **Why**: Eliminates unnecessary string formatting operations during parser initialization
- **Impact**: 
  - No functional changes for callers
  - Slightly reduced runtime overhead during benchmark setup
  - Improved code readability with simpler string literals

### `benchmark.bench.benchmarks`
- **What Changed**: No direct code modifications
- **Why**: Indirectly benefits from optimized parser initialization in `get_markdown_parsers`
- **Impact**:
  - Maintains identical benchmark results and output
  - Faster parser initialization during benchmark execution
  - No changes required for calling code

---

## Overall Impact Analysis
The changes work together to improve the efficiency of the benchmark suite while maintaining strict backward compatibility. By eliminating redundant string formatting in parser key creation, the codebase gains:
- **Performance**: Reduced initialization time for markdown parsers
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner syntax with simpler string literals
- **Consistency**: Uniform string formatting approach across parser definitions

The optimization demonstrates good engineering practice by removing unnecessary operations without altering any observable behavior, making the benchmark infrastructure more efficient while preserving its analytical accuracy.
