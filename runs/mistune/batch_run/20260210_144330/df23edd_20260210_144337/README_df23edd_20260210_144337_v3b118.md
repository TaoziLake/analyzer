# Commit df23edd: mistune v3.2.0 Version Bump and Parser Initialization Updates  

## Summary  
Commit `df23edd` updates the `mistune` package version from `3.1.4` to `3.2.0`, signaling the release of version 3.2.0. This change primarily affects package metadata and version reporting. While no direct code logic changes are visible in the provided diff, the version update is linked to indirect modifications in parser initialization logic for `BlockParser` and `InlineParser` classes, likely due to upstream changes in base class configurations. Documentation updates and Python 3.13 support configuration changes (in `.readthedocs.yaml`) are also included but not part of core code changes.  

---

## Changed Modules  
- **`src/mistune/__init__.py`**: Updated `__version__` from `"3.1.4"` to `"3.2.0"`.  

---

## Affected Functions  

### `src.mistune.block_parser.BlockParser.__init__`  
- **Change**: Docstring inserted using an LLM.  
- **Impact**: No direct code logic changes. The updated docstring may improve documentation clarity but does not alter runtime behavior.  

### `src.mistune.inline_parser.InlineParser.__init__`  
- **Change**: Docstring inserted using an LLM.  
- **Impact**: Subtle behavioral changes may arise from modified base class initialization logic (via `super().__init__()`), even though parameters remain unchanged. This could affect inherited parser configurations or internal state setup, potentially leading to minor differences in parsing behavior.  

---

## Overall Impact Analysis  
The commit primarily serves as a version release marker (`v3.2.0`), with no direct code logic changes visible in the provided diff. However, the associated updates to parser initialization logic (via inherited base class changes) suggest that this release may include under-the-hood refinements to parser configuration handling. While docstring updates improve developer documentation, users should test for edge-case parsing differences stemming from modified initialization flows in `BlockParser` and `InlineParser`. The version bump also signals broader ecosystem updates, including Python 3.13 compatibility.
