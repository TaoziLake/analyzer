# Commit 253dc76: Mistune v3.1.2 Version Bump and Plugin Fix

## Executive Summary
This commit updates the library version to **v3.1.2** and includes a fix for the `footnotes` plugin when used with AST renderers. While the direct code change only modifies version metadata in `src/mistune/__init__.py`, the update indirectly affects initialization logic in `InlineParser` and `BlockParser` classes due to upstream changes in their parent class constructors. These indirect impacts could alter parser behavior for markdown constructs and rule inheritance.

---

## Changed Modules
### `src/mistune/__init__.py`
- **Change**: Bumped version from `3.1.1` to `3.1.2`
- **Context**: The version update aligns with the documented fix for the `footnotes` plugin, though no direct code changes were made to plugin logic in this commit.

---

## Affected Functions

### `src.mistune.inline_parser.InlineParser.__init__` (hop 1)
- **Change**: Parent class `__init__` modified (via commit 253dc76)
- **Impact**:
  - If parent class now requires new initialization parameters, `InlineParser` instantiation may raise `TypeError`
  - Changes to parent initialization logic could alter base configuration behaviors (e.g., default inline rules)
- **Downstream Risk**: Potential breaking changes for consumers relying on implicit parent class initialization patterns

### `src.mistune.block_parser.BlockParser.__init__` (hop 1)
- **Change**: Parent class `__init__` modified (via commit 253dc76)
- **Impact**:
  - May affect inheritance of `DEFAULT_RULES` and `SPECIFICATION` attributes
  - Could change default parsing behavior for block quotes/lists when no explicit rules provided
  - May alter handling of nested block structures
- **Downstream Risk**: Subtle behavioral changes in markdown parsing without explicit configuration updates

---

## Overall Impact Analysis
While the commit appears minimal (version bump + changelog update), the indirect effects on parser initialization logic suggest deeper changes to class inheritance patterns in the parent class. The documented `footnotes` plugin fix likely involves hidden changes in other modules not shown here, but this version update serves as a coordination point for those fixes. Users should:

1. Verify parser instantiation patterns (especially for custom subclasses)
2. Test edge cases involving nested blocks and inline elements
3. Check footnote rendering behavior with AST targets

The version update acts as both a bugfix release marker and a coordination point for internal initialization logic changes that could surface latent issues in subclass implementations.
