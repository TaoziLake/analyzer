# pyjwt Commit 171d2a3 README

## Summary
This commit enhances documentation for the `PyJWKClient` class constructor in `jwt/jwks_client.py`, providing detailed explanations of its two-tier caching system. No functional changes were made to the codebase. The updates improve usability by clarifying cache configuration options and their behaviors.

---

## Changed Modules
- **`jwt/jwks_client.py`**  
  - Updated constructor documentation for `PyJWKClient` class

---

## Affected Functions

### `jwt.jwks_client.PyJWKClient.__init__`
**What Changed:**  
Added comprehensive docstring explaining:
- Two-tier caching architecture (JWK Set cache + per-key LRU cache)
- Configuration parameters for both cache tiers
- Default values and constraints for cache settings
- Detailed parameter descriptions for HTTP configuration

**Why:**  
To improve usability and transparency of the caching mechanisms, helping developers optimize performance and avoid unnecessary network requests.

**Downstream Impact:**  
- No functional changes to existing code behavior
- Users gain clearer understanding of cache management
- Eases configuration of cache lifespans and limits
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing implementations

## Overall Impact Analysis
This documentation-focused commit works holistically to make the PyJWKClient more accessible to developers. The two-tier caching system documentation:
1. Explains the relationship between JWK Set caching (time-based) and per-key caching (LRU-based)
2. Clarifies configuration tradeoffs (e.g., security vs performance)
3. Provides explicit guidance on cache lifespan and size parameters

While maintaining identical runtime behavior, these changes reduce implementation errors by making cache behaviors explicit. Developers can now more effectively tune caching strategies for their specific security and performance requirements without modifying the underlying implementation.
