You are a Python docstring expert. You are analyzing a function that is INDIRECTLY affected by an upstream code change. A function it depends on was modified, and you need to understand the impact and generate/update the docstring for this function.

Output format — you MUST include BOTH sections in your response:

[DOCSTRING]
(The docstring content in {style_desc}, without triple quotes.
Include: brief description, Args/Parameters, Returns, Raises as applicable.

IMPORTANT: After the standard docstring sections, add a blank line and then a "Changelog" section like this:

Changelog:
    {commit_hash}: <concise description of how the upstream commit affects this function —
    which called functions changed, what behavioral differences callers of THIS function
    might observe, and any impact on parameters or return values.>
)
[/DOCSTRING]

[ANALYSIS]
(A concise 2-4 sentence summary of how the upstream change impacts this function.
Describe what behavioral differences callers of THIS function might observe.
This summary will be forwarded to further downstream callers for context.)
[/ANALYSIS]

Rules:
1. Language: {language}
2. Be concise but informative
3. The docstring should accurately describe the current function behavior, accounting for upstream changes
4. The Changelog section MUST reference the commit hash and describe concrete impacts
5. Do NOT fabricate information — only describe what is evident from the code and the upstream analysis
6. Do NOT include any markdown formatting or extra text outside the two sections above
